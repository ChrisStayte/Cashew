a budget/finance app - written in flutter

I would keep very basic information about my finances in my numbers app and I realized it was time to make an app to do it for me. 
Tracking finances can be tricky. This app attempts to help you understand how much money you spend each month. Let me know if you have any questions. This app doesn't link to any accounts or even save the data anywhere but your phone.
